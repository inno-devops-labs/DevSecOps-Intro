# Lab 8 — Submission

## Task 1: Sign + Tamper Demo

### Registry + image push
- Registry container: `lab8-registry` running on `localhost:5000`
- Image pushed: `localhost:5000/juice-shop:v20.0.0`
- Image digest: `localhost:5000/juice-shop@sha256:28870b9d2bec49e605d6ebbf4b22ed1ec1ca0a72347ef19217bbbb21ea44e3fe`

### Signing
- Output of `cosign sign` (just the success line is fine):
```
Signing artifact...
Pushing signature to: localhost:5000/juice-shop
```

### Verification (PASSED)
Output of `cosign verify` on original digest:
```json
[{"critical":{"identity":{"docker-reference":"localhost:5000/juice-shop@sha256:28870b9d2bec49e605d6ebbf4b22ed1ec1ca0a72347ef19217bbbb21ea44e3fe"},"image":{"docker-manifest-digest":"sha256:28870b9d2bec49e605d6ebbf4b22ed1ec1ca0a72347ef19217bbbb21ea44e3fe"},"type":"https://sigstore.dev/cosign/sign/v1"},"optional":{}}]
```

### Tamper Demo (FAILED — correctly)
Output of `cosign verify` on tampered digest:
```
WARNING: Skipping tlog verification is an insecure practice that lacks transparency and auditability verification for the signature.
Error: no signatures found
error during command execution: no signatures found
```

### Sanity — original still verifies
```
WARNING: Skipping tlog verification is an insecure practice that lacks transparency and auditability verification for the signature.
Verification for localhost:5000/juice-shop@sha256:28870b9d2bec49e605d6ebbf4b22ed1ec1ca0a72347ef19217bbbb21ea44e3fe --
The following checks were performed on each of these signatures:
  - The cosign claims were validated
  - Existence of the claims in the transparency log was verified offline
  - The signatures were verified against the specified public key

```

### Why digest binding matters (Lecture 8 slide 6)
The tampered tag pointed to a different digest, while the Cosign signature was bound to the original immutable digest. If Cosign signed only the mutable tag, an attacker could retag a malicious image as `v20.0.0` and inherit trust from the old tag name. Digest binding prevents that tag-mutation attack because verification follows the exact manifest hash.

## Task 2: SBOM + Provenance Attestations

### SBOM attestation
- Attached: yes (`cosign attest --type cyclonedx` exit 0)
- Verify-attestation output (first 30 lines of decoded payload):
```json

  "_type": "https://in-toto.io/Statement/v0.1",

      }
    }

```
- Component count matches Lab 4 source: yes
- diff between Lab 4 SBOM and the extracted-from-attestation SBOM: `<>`

### Provenance attestation
- Attached: yes
- Builder ID in predicate: `https://localhost/lab8-student`
- buildType in predicate: `https://example.com/lab8/local-build`

### What this gives a Lab 9 verifier (2-3 sentences)
At K8s admission time, a Kyverno verify-images policy can require the image signature and the CycloneDX attestation before allowing deployment. A signed image without an SBOM only proves who signed the digest; it does not provide a queryable component inventory. A signed image with an SBOM lets the verifier or incident workflow answer the next Log4Shell-style question by checking whether the attested image contains the affected package.

## Bonus: Blob Signing (Codecov 2021 mitigation)

### Sign + verify
- Signed: `my-tool.tar.gz` + `my-tool.tar.gz.bundle`
- Verify-blob success output:
```
Verified OK
```

### Tamper test failed (correctly)
```
Error: failed to verify signature: could not verify message: invalid signature when validating ASN.1 encoded signature
error during command execution: failed to verify signature: could not verify message: invalid signature when validating ASN.1 encoded signature
```

### Codecov 2021 mitigation (2-3 sentences)
Codecov's bash uploader was distributed through `curl | bash` without verifying the downloaded bytes. If consumers had required `cosign verify-blob --key cosign.pub --bundle uploader.bundle uploader.sh` before execution, the modified uploader would not have matched the signed byte stream. The pipeline would fail before running the attacker-controlled script and before CI environment variables could be exfiltrated.
